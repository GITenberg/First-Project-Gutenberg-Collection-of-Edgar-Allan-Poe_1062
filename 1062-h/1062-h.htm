<tr>
<td><font size="+1">O</font>NCE upon a midnight dreary, while I
pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten
lore&mdash;<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a
tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some visitor,&rdquo; I muttered,
&ldquo;tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">Only this and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the
floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to
borrow<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost
Lenore&mdash;<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name
Lenore&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">Nameless here for evermore.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple
curtain<br>
Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt
before;<br>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
repeating<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber
door&mdash;<br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;<br>
<p class="noindent">This it is and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no
longer,<br>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or Madam, truly your
forgiveness I implore;<br>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came
rapping,<br>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
That I scarce was sure I heard you&rdquo;&mdash;here I opened
wide the door;&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there
wondering, fearing,<br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream
before;<br>
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no
token,<br>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
&ldquo;Lenore!&rdquo;<br>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
&ldquo;Lenore!&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">Merely this and nothing more.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me
burning,<br>
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br>
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;surely that is something at
my window lattice;<br>
Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery
explore&mdash;<br>
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery
explore;&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">&rsquo;Tis the wind and nothing
more.&rdquo;</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and
flutter,<br>
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed
he,<br>
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber
door&mdash;<br>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber
door&mdash;<br>
<p class="noindent">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>

<td>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
&ldquo;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;art sure no craven,<br>
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly
shore&mdash;<br>
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night&rsquo;s Plutonian
shore!&rdquo;<br>

plainly,<br>
Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber
door&mdash;<br>
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber
door,<br>
<p class="noindent">With such name as
&ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;</p>
</td>

only<br>
That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did
outpour.<br>
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he
fluttered&mdash;<br>
Till I scarcely more than muttered: &ldquo;Other friends have
flown before&mdash;<br>
On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown
before.&rdquo;<br>

&ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;</p>

spoken,<br>

only stock and store,<br>
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden
bore&mdash;<br>
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
<p class="noindent">Of
&lsquo;Never&mdash;nevermore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

smiling,<br>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and

Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of
yore&mdash;<br>
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of
yore<br>

<h2><a name="2">THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH</a></h2>
</center>

<p><br>
<font size="+1">T</font>HE &ldquo;Red Death&rdquo; had long
devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or
so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&mdash;the redness
and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden
dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with
dissolution. The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon
the face of the victim, were the pest ban which shut him out from
the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men. And the whole
seizure, progress, and termination of the disease, were the
incidents of half an hour.</p>

<p>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious.
When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his
presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the
knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the
deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an
extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the
prince&rsquo;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty
wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,
having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the
bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress
to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The
abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers
might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take
care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to
think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.
There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were
ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was
wine. All these and security were within. Without was the
&ldquo;Red Death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his
seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad,
that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a
masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.</p>

<p>It was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me
tell of the rooms in which it was held. These were seven&mdash;an
imperial suite. In many palaces, however, such suites form a long
and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to
the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extent is
scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different, as might have
been expected from the duke&rsquo;s love of the <i>bizarre</i>.
The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision
embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp
turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel
effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall
and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which
pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained
glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of
the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the
eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue&mdash;and
vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in
its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The
third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth
was furnished and lighted with orange&mdash;the fifth with
white&mdash;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was
closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over
the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a
carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only,
the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
decorations. The panes here were scarlet&mdash;a deep blood
color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp
or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay
scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no
light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite
of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there
stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier
of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so
glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude
of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black
chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark
hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the
extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of
those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough
to set foot within its precincts at all.</p>

<p>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the
western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to
and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the
minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be
stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound
which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of
so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour,
the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,
momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and
thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was
a brief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the
chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest
grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over
their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the
echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the
assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at
their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each
to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce
in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty
minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of
the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the
clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and
meditation as before.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent
revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye
for colors and effects. He disregarded the <i>decora</i> of mere
fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions
glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have
thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was
necessary to hear and see and touch him to be <i>sure</i> that he
was not.</p>

<p>He had directed, in great part, the movable embellishments of
the seven chambers, upon occasion of this great
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>; and it was his own guiding taste which had
given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque.
There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and
phantasm&mdash;much of what has been since seen in
&ldquo;Hernani.&rdquo; There were arabesque figures with unsuited
limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the
madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the
wanton, much of the <i>bizarre</i>, something of the terrible,
and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and
fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of
dreams. And these&mdash;the dreams&mdash;writhed in and about,
taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the
orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there
strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.
And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the
voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.
But the echoes of the chime die away&mdash;they have endured but
an instant&mdash;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after
them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the
dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking
hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays
from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly
of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for
the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through
the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery
appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there
comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly
emphatic than any which reaches <i>their</i> ears who indulge in
the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.</p>

<p>But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them
beat feverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly
on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon
the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the
evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy
cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve
strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it
happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,
into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.
And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes
of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many
individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of
the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention
of no single individual before. And the rumor of this new
presence having spread itself whisperingly around, there arose at
length from the whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of
disapprobation and surprise&mdash;then, finally, of terror, of
horror, and of disgust.</p>

<p>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may
well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited
such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was
nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded
Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince&rsquo;s
indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most
reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the
utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are
matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed,
seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the
stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall
and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of
the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly
to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the
closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat.
And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the
mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume
the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in
<i>blood</i>&mdash;and his broad brow, with all the features of
the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>

<p>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral
image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully
to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he
was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong
shudder either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow
reddened with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who dares&rdquo;&mdash;he demanded hoarsely of the
courtiers who stood near him&mdash;&ldquo;who dares insult us
with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and unmask
him&mdash;that we may know whom we have to hang, at sunrise, from
the battlements!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the
Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout
the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and
robust man, and the music had become hushed at the waving of his
hand.</p>

<p>It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group
of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a
slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the
intruder, who, at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with
deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker.
But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of
the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none
who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed
within a yard of the prince&rsquo;s person; and, while the vast
assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the
rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the
same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from
the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&mdash;through
the purple to the green&mdash;through the green to the
orange&mdash;through this again to the white&mdash;and even
thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to
arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,
maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,
rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed
him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He
bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid
impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating
figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the
velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.
There was a sharp cry&mdash;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon
the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterward, fell prostrate
in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of
despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into
the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure
stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock,
gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and
corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness,
untenanted by any tangible form.</p>

<p>And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had
come like a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the
revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died
each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the
ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the
flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red
Death held illimitable dominion over all.<br>

<h2><a name="3">THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO</a></h2>
</center>

<p><br>
<font size="+1">T</font>HE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had
borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed
revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not
suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. <i>At
length</i> I would be avenged; this was a point definitely
settled&mdash;but the very definitiveness with which it was
resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but
punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the
avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done
the wrong.</p>

<p>It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I
given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was
my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my
smile <i>now</i> was at the thought of his immolation.</p>

<p>He had a weak point&mdash;this Fortunato&mdash;although in
other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He
prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have
the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is
adopted to suit the time and opportunity&mdash;to practise
imposture upon the British and Austrian <i>millionaires</i>. In
painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a
quack&mdash;but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In
this respect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful
in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I
could.</p>

<p>It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of
the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me
with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man
wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and
his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so
pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done
wringing his hand.</p>

<p>I said to him: &ldquo;My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.
How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a
pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my
doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Amontillado? A pipe?
Impossible! And in the middle of the carnival!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my doubts,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and I was
silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting
you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of
losing a bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amontillado!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have my doubts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amontillado!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I must satisfy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amontillado!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any
one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a
match for your own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your vaults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.
I perceive you have an engagement. Luchesi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no engagement;&mdash;come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe
cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are
insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing.
Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he
cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting
on a mask of black silk, and drawing a <i>roquelaire</i> closely
about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.</p>

<p>There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make
merry in honor of the time. I had told them that I should not
return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not
to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well
knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as
soon as my back was turned.</p>

<p>I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to
Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the
archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and
winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed.
We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together
on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.</p>

<p>The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap
jingled as he strode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pipe?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is farther on,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but observe the
white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy
orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nitre?&rdquo; he asked, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nitre,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;How long have you had
that cough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh! ugh! ugh!&mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh!&mdash;ugh! ugh!
ugh!&mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh!&mdash;ugh! ugh! ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he said, at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, with decision, &ldquo;we will go
back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired,
beloved; you are happy, as once I was. You are a man to be
missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill,
and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is
Luchesi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the cough is a mere
nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a
cough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;true,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and, indeed,
I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily; but you should
use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us
from the damps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a
long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; I said, presenting him the wine.</p>

<p>He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to
me familiarly, while his bells jingled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the buried that
repose around us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I to your long life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He again took my arm, and we proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These vaults,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are
extensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Montresors,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;were a great
and numerous family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forget your arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A huge human foot d&rsquo;or, in a field azure; the
foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the
heel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the motto?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Nemo me impune lacessit.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own
fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of
piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the
inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I
made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nitre!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;see, it increases. It
hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river&rsquo;s
bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will
go back ere it is too late. Your cough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let us go on. But
first, another draught of the Medoc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I broke and reached him a flagon of De Gr&acirc;ve. He emptied
it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed
and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not
understand.</p>

<p>I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement&mdash;a
grotesque one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not comprehend?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are not of the brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not of the masons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? Impossible! A mason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mason,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sign,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; I answered, producing a trowel from
beneath the folds of my <i>roquelaire</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You jest,&rdquo; he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.
&ldquo;But let us proceed to the Amontillado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; I said, replacing the tool beneath the
cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily.
We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed
through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and
descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness
of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.</p>

<p>At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another
less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled
to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of
Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented
in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down,
and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a
mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the
displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in
depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It
seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within
itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the
colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by
one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch,
endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination
the feeble light did not enable us to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;herein is the
Amontillado. As for Luchesi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is an ignoramus,&rdquo; interrupted my friend, as he
stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his
heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche,
and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly
bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.
In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other
about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short
chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his
waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was
too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back
from the recess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass your hand,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;over the wall;
you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed, it is <i>very</i>
damp. Once more let me <i>implore</i> you to return. No? Then I
must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the
little attentions in my power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amontillado!&rdquo; ejaculated my friend, not yet
recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;the
Amontillado.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones
of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon
uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these
materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to
wall up the entrance of the niche.</p>

<p>I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I
discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great
measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low
moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was <i>not</i> the
cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate
silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth;
and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise
lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to
it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down
upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the
trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth,
and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with
my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the
mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.</p>

<p>A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly
from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me
violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated&mdash;I trembled.
Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess;
but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon
the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. I
reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who
clamored. I re-echoed&mdash;I aided&mdash;I surpassed them in
volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamorer grew
still.</p>

<p>It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had
completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had
finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained
but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled
with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position.
But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected
the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I
had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble Fortunato. The
voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;he! he!&mdash;a very good joke
indeed&mdash;an excellent jest. We shall have many a rich laugh
about it at the palazzo&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;over our
wine&mdash;he! he! he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Amontillado!&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;yes, the
Amontillado. But is it not getting late? Will not they be
awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let
us be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>For the love of God, Montresor!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for the love of
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew
impatient. I called aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunato!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer. I called again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunato!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining
aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in reply only a
jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick&mdash;on account of the
dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labor.
I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up.
Against the new masonry I re-erected the old rampart of bones.
For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. <i>In
pace requiescat!</i><br>
<br>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
